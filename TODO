I like this kind of printing:
...
| (0045,1032) : FL   Len: 4      <Unknown Tag>                  Value: [     1.000]
| (7FE0,0000) : UL   Len: 4      GroupLength7FE0                Value: [524300]
| (7FE0,0010) : OW   Len: 524288 PixelData                      Value: [OW/OB Binary data]
END-OF-DATASET 


For debugging purpose, it would be nice to allow printing the value offset too.

Remember :
3 levels for message printing :

Warning  : Warns the user when some oddity occured, and we used an heuristics to
           bypass the trouble.
           e.g. : SamplesPerPixel missing, we assume it's a grey level image
                : Pixel Representation missing : we assume 'unsigned'
           (we hope our assumption is OK, but user may disagree.)
		  
Log : we display messages when anything is not Dicom Kosher 
      e.g. : non even length field
           : file is declared as Explicit VR, but a DataElement is Implicit
	   : a file hols illegal groups (0x0005, ...)
    
Debug : We help developper to trace, at a glance, the execution 
        (before refining it with a debugging tool)

Setting ON Debug leads to set ON Warning (but not Log)
Setting ON Log   leads to set ON Warning (but not Debug)
