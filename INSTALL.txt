If you are reading this file, it certainly means you do not know how to build GDCM. See:
http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Configuring_and_Building

On UNIX (with cmake) this is simply a matter of doing:
 * svn co https://gdcm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gdcm/branches/gdcm-2-0 gdcm
 * mkdir gdcmbin
 * cd gdcmbin
 * ccmake ../gdcm
   [select your configuration]
 * Press 'c' (configure), Press 'g' (generate)
 * make
The following step is not required, as gdcm will work from a build tree too:
 * make install

If you want to live on the edge, you should try the latest trunk instead:

 * svn co https://gdcm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gdcm/trunk gdcm
