After some search on internet this is the same version as the one in libtiff that was used.
License is compatible. 
Look for any update at:
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/include/getopt.h
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/stdlib/getopt.c
and
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/stdlib/getopt_long.c

The lib compiles with warnings but since my main target plateform remains a GNU/Linux whoever wants the warnings to be fix, should send me a patch.
